![img1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3bceb90-04fb-4985-8429-d9085ae1707c)

<p>This project explores the development and implementation of machine learning models for detecting fraudulent activities in various domains, such as financial transactions, insurance claims, and e-commerce. This project provides a comprehensive framework for building, training, and evaluating fraud detection models, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation.</p>

<h2>WORKFLOW</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Credit Card Dataset Collection</strong>
      <br>
      This dataset has been collected from Kaggle. Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
  </li>
  <li><strong>Data Preprocessing</strong>
      <br>
      As the data was highly unbalanced, preprocessing was necessary.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Data Analysis</strong>
      <br>
      Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to gain insights into the data.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Train Test Split</strong>
      <br>
      The data is divided into training and testing sets. The training set is used to build the machine learning model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Logistic Regression Model</strong>
      <br>
      A logistic regression model is trained on the training data. This model is suitable for binary classification problems like fraud detection (fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions).
  </li>
  <li><strong>Evaluation</strong>
      <br>
      The trained model is evaluated on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics help assess the model's ability to detect fraudulent transactions accurately.
